This package contains data files used in the article "Exoskeleton: Curve Network Abstraction for 3D Shapes". 
The files are organized in three directories:
* ./models: Meshes in OFF format.
* ./segs: Part-based segmentations used in our experiments. The file format is described in the C++ class SegIO.
* ./atlas: Patch-based segmentation generated by our algorithm. The file format is described in the C++ class AtlasIO.
